# the risk/reward of using global variables

# risk - consider the software system for an airliner
#		critical piece - flight control system
#		non-critical piece - in-flight entertainment system

# both systems might use a variable called "dial"
# we don't want possibility that change the volume on your audio
# causes the plane's flaps to change!
